# akka-pure-actor

__akka-pure-actor__ provides an opinionated `PersistentActor` implementation
based on immutable state and a simple update scheme, similar to [Redux][redux]
and Clojure's [re-frame][reframe].

## Quickstart

```scala
import org.xsc.pure.PurePersistentActor
```

Internally, we have some kind of actor __state__, e.g.:

```scala
final case class State(value: Int = 0) {
    def updateValue(f: Int => Int) =
      this.copy(value = f(this.value))
}
```

A pure actor gets triggered by an __action__, a datastructure representing
complex logic:

```scala
sealed trait Action
final case object Double extends Action
final case object Reset  extends Action
```

These actions translate to __effects__, simple logical parts of the overall
action:

```scala
sealed trait Effect
case class Increment(by: Int = 1) extends Effect
case class Decrement(by: Int = 1) extends Effect

def handleCounterAction(state: State, action: Action): (Option[String], List[Effect]) = {
  action match {
    case Double => (None, List(Increment(state.value)))
    case Reset => (None, List(Decrement(state.value)))
  }
}
```

And these effects have an impact on the actor state, represented by an update
function:

```scala
def updateCounterState(state: State, effect: Effect): State {
  effect match {
    case Increment(by) => state.updateValue(_ + by)
    case Decrement(by) => state.updateValue(_ - by)
  }
}
```

So far, everything is pure â€“ we even assume that all information necessary for
action validation/handling is contained within the state. But at some point, we
might need to alter the world:

```scala
def propagateCounterEffect: PartialFunction[Effect, Unit] = {
  case Increment(by) => persistIncrementToDB(by)
  case Decrement(by) => persistDecrementToDB(by)
}
```

The code to wire all this together is basically just boilerplate that should
change very rarely:

```scala
final class Counter extends PurePersistentActor[Action, Effect, String, State] {
  val persistenceId = "counter"

  lazy val initialState = State()
  val updateState       = updateCounterState
  val handleAction      = handleCounterAction
  val propagateEffect   = propagateCounterEffect

  override def wrapReceive(receiveAction: Action => Unit,
                           receiveEffect: Effect => Unit): Receive = {
    case action: Action => receiveAction(action)
    case effect: Effect => receiveEffect(effect)
  }
}
```
